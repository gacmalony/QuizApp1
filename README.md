Hi everyone im Kaan, i wrote this project not so complex. 
Basically i wanted to use an app to learn German more efficiently . But i couldnt find an app for free and that app basically helping to my goals.
I used this project a few Months and i took the German B1 certificate.

Has a manually repository for words(Python file), You can add which word you want manually. When you run, App will test you with those words , and if you know the answer just click to the green Marked box and program will do nothing about this word.
If youre not sure, just click red marked box and program will translate this word for you and show on the output area. Additionally will save as json format in another Python file. 
With cool interface ready to use. Basic and functional!
